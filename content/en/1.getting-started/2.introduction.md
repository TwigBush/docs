## What is TwigBush?

TwigBush is an early open source implementation of the [Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP, RFC 9635)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9635.html) written in Go. It provides the foundation for a **GNAP Authorization Server (AS)** and supporting libraries for **Resource Servers (RS)**, enabling modern, key-bound access control for both human users and AI agents. We’re building this project in the open to grow a community around secure, next-generation authorization.

## Why GNAP?

GNAP represents the next evolution in authorization protocols, designed to address limitations in OAuth 2.0 and provide:

- **Key-Bound Tokens**: Every access token is cryptographically bound to the client's key
- **Proof-of-Possession**: Prevents token replay attacks with DPoP, mTLS, or HTTP Message Signatures
- **No Client Pre-Registration**: Dynamic client instances without pre-shared secrets
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Request specific resources with precise constraints
- **Machine-Friendly**: Native support for non-browser, automated clients

## Core Features

### Authorization Server
- Complete implementation of GNAP core endpoints
- `/grant` - Initiate authorization requests
- `/continue` - Handle interaction continuation
- `/introspect` - Token validation for resource servers
- `/.well-known/jwks.json` - Public key discovery

### Security Features
- **Proof Methods**: Detached JWS, HTTP Message Signatures, DPoP, mTLS
- **Short-Lived Tokens**: Configurable TTL with automatic expiration
- **Key Rotation**: Built-in support for key lifecycle management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking

### Integration Options
- **Policy Engines**: OpenFGA adapter for Zanzibar-style authorization
- **Resource Servers**: Example implementations and client libraries
- **Storage Backends**: PostgreSQL with migration support
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health endpoints

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Docker (for PostgreSQL and OpenFGA)
- Git

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TwigBush/TwigBush.git
cd TwigBush
go mod download
```

### Running the Authorization Server

Start the AS with default configuration:

```bash
go run ./cmd/as
```

The server starts on port **8085** by default. Verify it's running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8085/.well-known/jwks.json
```
